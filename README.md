Transparent reading of files from Flutter assets, Internet (by URL), zip archives by uploader priority.
The easy-to-use and [well-tested](https://github.com/signmotion/cross_file_manager/tree/master/test) package.
Feel free to use it in your awesome project.

Share some ‚ù§Ô∏è and star repo to support the [Cross File Manager](https://github.com/signmotion/cross_file_manager).

_If you write an article about **CrossFileManager** or any of [these](https://pub.dev/packages?q=publisher%3Asyrokomskyi.com&sort=updated) packages, let me know and I'll post the URL of the article in the **README**_ ü§ù

## üåü Features

We can choose with **CrossFileManager** the priority for uploaders yourself. For example, if the file is not in the assets, an attempt will be made to get the file from the cloud.

Can develop own loader for download files from Firebase, Firestore, Amazon AWS, Google Drive, Microsoft Azure Cloud Storage, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc. - any data source can be included in the CrossFileManager. See `class Loader` and [already implemented loaders](https://github.com/signmotion/cross_file_manager/tree/master/lib/src/loaders).

Can retrieve the needed file from an archive. It comes in handy when you need to download thousands of small files.

Can memorize a received file and retrieve it from local storage the next time it is requested.

Able to download files in formats:

- `String`
- `Image` like `dart.ui`
- `Image` like `package:flutter/widgets.dart`
- `File`, binary data

### How it works

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/signmotion/cross_file_manager/master/images/request_response.webp" width="600"/>](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/signmotion/cross_file_manager/master/images/request_response.webp)

## üöÄ Usage

### Create a Manager for App

```dart
final fm = CrossFileManager.create(
  loaders: const [
    PlainAssetsLoader(),
    ZipAssetsLoader(),
    PlainFileLoader(),
    ZipFileLoader(),
  ],
);
```

### Use the Manager in App

```dart
final r = await fm.loadString(path);
```

```dart
final r = await fm.loadFile(path);
```

```dart
final r = await fm.loadImageUi(path);
```

```dart
final r = await fm.loadImageWidget(path);
```

```dart
final r = await fm.exists(path);
```

```dart
final r = await fm.existsInCache(path);
```

```dart
// Just add a file to cache for fast access in the future.
await fm.warmUp(path);
```

The manager announced above will search file by `path` in the local assets,
then in the zip archives of local assets,
then in the local filesystem,
then in the zip archives of local filesystem.

It will return the first file found.

See `example/main.dart` for more use cases:

## üëã Welcome

If you encounter any problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/signmotion/cross_file_manager/issues). If you feel the package is missing a feature, please [raise a ticket](https://github.com/signmotion/cross_file_manager/issues) on Github and I'll look into it. Requests and suggestions are warmly welcome. Danke!

Contributions are what make the open-source community such a great place to learn, create, take a new skills, and be inspired.

If this is your first contribution, I'll leave you with some of the best links I've found: they will help you get started or/and become even more efficient.

The package **CrossFileManager** is open-source, stable and well-tested. Development happens on
[GitHub](https://github.com/signmotion/cross_file_manager). Feel free to report issues
or create a pull-request there.

General questions are best asked on
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cross_file_manager).

And here is a curated list of how you can help:

- Documenting the undocumented. Whenever you come across a class, property, or method within our codebase that you're familiar with and notice it lacks documentation, kindly spare a couple of minutes to jot down some helpful notes for your fellow developers.
- Refining the code. While I'm aware it's primarily my responsibility to refactor the code, I wholeheartedly welcome any contributions you're willing to make in this area. Your insights and improvements are appreciated!
- Constructive code reviews. Should you discover a more efficient approach to achieve something, I'm all ears. Your suggestions for enhancement are invaluable.
- Sharing your examples. If you've experimented with our use cases or have crafted some examples of your own, feel free to add them to the `example` directory. Your practical insights can enrich our resource pool.
- Fix typos/grammar mistakes.
- Report bugs and scenarios that are difficult to implement.
- Implement new features by making a pull-request.

## ‚úÖ TODO (perhaps)

Once you start using the **CrossFileManager**, it will become easy to choose the functionality to contribute. But if you already get everything you need from this package but have some free time, let me write here what I have planned:

- Separate the package to work with pure Dart.
- Replace `File` to `WFile`. <https://pub.dev/packages/wfile>
- Change chunks of code for transform images to [flutter_image_converter](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_image_converter).

It's just a habit of mine: writing down ideas that come to mind while working on a project. I confess that I rarely return to these notes. But now, hopefully, even if you don't have an idea yet, the above notes will help you choose the suitable "feature" and become a contributor to the open-source community.
